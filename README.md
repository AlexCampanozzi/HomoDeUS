Welcome to the repository for the HomoDeUS project created by seven students in robotics and software engineering at the Universit√© de Sherbrooke.
Here are the steps to build the project from scratch.

##Create an ubuntu environment with PAL Robotics packages
You should have access to a .iso file containing installation file for the PAL Robotics environment
Select Install Development TIAGo 82 during booting to create a permament environment.
Select Run to have a temporary environment without it taking place in you hard drive

###Credentials
Username:pal
Password:pal

Admin username:root
Admin password:palroot

##Network
If you are in a VM it is possible that you have no internet connection.
To fix the problem, edit /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml to add this:
	network:
		version: 2
		renderer: NetworkManager
		ethernets:
		    enp0s3:
		        dhcp4: true

verify that the edits worked with
	sudo netplan apply

then restart the server
	sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

Depending on your network configuration, it may be ens33 instead of enp0s3 that you have to put in the file

##Configure a catkin workspace
	mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
	cd catkin_ws/src

###Setup your SSH keys
Before being able to use git you have to generate SSH keys for your new environment:
Procedure here: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

##Clone HomoDeUS
then clone the repo in src
	git clone git@github.com:AlexCampanozzi/HomoDeUS.git

###Clone HBBA
To make the project work you will also need HBBA. Complete documentation is at https://github.com/introlab/HBBA
	git clone git@github.com:introlab/HBBA.git
	cd iw_translator/or_tools/
	./generate_dpkg.sh
	sudo dpkg -i or-tools_ubuntu-18.04_v7.1.6720.deb
