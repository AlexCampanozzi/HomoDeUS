Welcome to the repository for the HomoDeUS project created by seven students in robotics and software engineering at the Universit√© de Sherbrooke.
Here are the steps to build the project from scratch. You can also run the script 
### Prepare the environment

## Create an ubuntu environment with PAL Robotics packages
You should have access to a .iso file containing installation file for the PAL Robotics environment  
Select Install Development TIAGo 82 during booting to create a permament environment.  
Select Run to have a temporary environment without it taking place in you hard drive

## Credentials
Username: pal  
Password: pal  

Admin username: root  
Admin password: palroot

## Network
If you are in a VM it is possible that you have no internet connection.  
To fix the problem, edit /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml to add this:

	network:
		version: 2
		renderer: NetworkManager
		ethernets:
		    enp0s3:
		        dhcp4: true

verify that the edits worked with

	sudo netplan apply

then restart the server

	sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

Depending on your network configuration, it may be ens33 instead of enp0s3 that you have to put in the file

## Configure a catkin workspace
	mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
	cd catkin_ws/src

## Setup your SSH keys
Before being able to use git you have to generate SSH keys for your new environment:  
Procedure here: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

## Clone repos
# Clone HomoDeUS
then clone the repo in src

	git clone git@github.com:AlexCampanozzi/HomoDeUS.git

# Clone HBBA
To make the project work you will also need HBBA. Complete documentation is at https://github.com/introlab/HBBA

	git clone git@github.com:introlab/HBBA.git
	cd iw_translator/or_tools/
	./generate_dpkg.sh
	sudo dpkg -i or-tools_ubuntu-18.04_v7.1.6720.deb

# Clone darknet_ros
You will also need to clone YOLO. Complete documentation at https://github.com/leggedrobotics/darknet_ros

	cd ~/catkin_ws/src
	git clone --recursive git@github.com:leggedrobotics/darknet_ros.git
	cd ../
	catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

## Install the necessary packages and modules
# Install Pip
Since the project is on ROS Melodic, it is in Python 2.7 by default. Pip deprecated support for Python 2.7 so it can't be installed directly. You will have to install it manually from the source.

	cd ~
	sudo apt-get install curl
	curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
	python get-pip.py 

This will install the last compatible version of pip.

# Install dependencies

	cd ~/catkin_ws/src/HomoDeUS
	./install_dependencies.sh

# Initialize git submodules for HBBA
	
	cd ~/catkin_ws/src/HBBA
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

## Create the Gazebo world

To be able to save changes, the Gazebo world used for the project is in a folder on the GitHub, you will have to copy it to your computer's folder to be able to use it in Gazebo

	sudo cp ~/catkin_ws/src/HomoDeUS/homodeus_common/worlds/homodeus_office.world /opt/pal/ferrum/share/pal_gazebo_worlds/worlds

## Build the project

	cd ~/catkin_ws
	source devel/setup.bash
	catkin_make
